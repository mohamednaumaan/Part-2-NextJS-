Project Name: Product Listing using NextJS

This project is a Next.js application that focuses on creating a product listing page. The emphasis is on leveraging Next.js for its routing capabilities, server-side rendering, and overall project structure. The goal is to display a product listing page taking advantage of the features offered by Next.js.
